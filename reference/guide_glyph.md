# Drop glyph guide

Guide for drop glyph consists of two axes and a sequence of example drop
grobs illustrating the mapping between uncertainty and glyph rotation
angles.

## Usage

``` r
GuideGlyph

guide_glyph(
  theme = NULL,
  title = waiver(),
  order = 99,
  position = NULL,
  direction = "vertical"
)
```

## Arguments

- theme:

  A [`theme`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html) object
  to style the guide individually or differently from the plot's theme
  settings. The `theme` argument in the guide partially overrides, and
  is combined with, the plot's theme. Arguments that apply to a single
  legend are respected, most of which have the `legend`-prefix.
  Arguments that apply to combined legends (the legend box) are ignored,
  including `legend.position`, `legend.justification.*`,
  `legend.location` and `legend.box.*`.

- title:

  A character string or expression indicating a title of guide. If
  `NULL`, the title is not shown. By default
  ([`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)),
  the name of the scale object or the name specified in
  [`labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html) is used
  for the title.

- order:

  positive integer less than 99 that specifies the order of this guide
  among multiple guides. This controls the order in which multiple
  guides are displayed, not the contents of the guide itself. If 0
  (default), the order is determined by a secret algorithm.

- position:

  A character string indicating where the legend should be placed
  relative to the plot panels. One of "top", "right", "bottom", "left",
  or "inside".

- direction:

  A character string indicating the direction of the guide. One of
  "horizontal" or "vertical".

## Details

Rotation angles range from \\\pi\\ to \\-\pi\\, corresponding to the
minimum and maximum uncertainty values respectively.
